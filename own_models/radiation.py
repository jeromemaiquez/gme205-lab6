class Radiation:
    """
    The radiation model for human migration. This model assumes that the choice
    of a traveler's destination consists of two steps:

        1. Each opportunity in every location is assigned a "fitness", represented by a
        number :math:`z`, chosen from some distribution :math:`P(z)` whose value represents
        the quality of the opoprtunity for the traveler.
        2. The traveler ranks all opportunities according to their distances from the origin
        location and chooses the closest opportunity with a fitness higher than the traveler's
        fitness threshold (another number extracted from the fitness distribution :math:`P(z)`).

    Thus, the average number of travelers from location :math:`i` to location :math:`j` takes the form:

        .. math::
            T_{ij} - O_i \\frac{m_i}{M}\\frac{m_i m_j}{(m_i + s_{ij})(m_i + m_j + s_{ij})}.

    The destination of the :math:`O_i` trips originating in :math:`i` is sampled from a distribution
    of probabilities that a trip originating in :math:`i` ends in location :math:`j`. This probability depends on:
        
        - the number of opportunities at the origin :math:`m_i`
        - the number of opportunities at the destination :math:`m_j`
        - the number of opportunities :math:`s_{ij}` within a circle of radius :math:`r_{ij}`
        centered in :math:`i` (excluding the source and destination themselves).

    This conditional probability needs to be normalized so that the probability that a trip originating in the
    region of interest ends in this region is equal to 1. In case of a finite system it is possible to show
    that this is equal to :math:`1 - \\frac{m_i}{M}`, where :math:`M=\\sum_i m_i` is the total number of opportunities.

    In the original version of the radiation model, the number of opportunities is approximated by the population,
    but the total inflows :math:`D_j` to each destination can also be used.
